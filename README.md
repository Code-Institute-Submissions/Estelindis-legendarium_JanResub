# Deployment

## Deploying to Heroku

- Log into Heroku (creating an account if needed).
- Click the "New" button from the dashboard, under the header in the top right corner.
- Choose "Create new app."
- Enter your application name, which has to be unique. Then select your region and click "Create App."
- From your project page, click the "Settings" tab and scroll to "Config Vars."
- Enter "PORT" in the KEY input field, then enter "8000" in the VALUE input field.
- Click the "Add" button to add the Convig Vars.
- On the same page, scroll to the buildpacks section and click "Add Buildpack."
- Add the Python and node.js buildpacks, ensuring that the Python buildpack is listed above the node.js buildpack.
- Go back to the tabs at the top of the page, then select the "Deploy" tab.
- Select the Github deployment method.
- Search for your repository name, then click the "Connect" button to link your repository.
- At the bottom of that page, select deployment type: Automatic Deployment or Manual Deployment. Automatic Deployment will redeploy the project to Heroku every time it is pushed to GitHun. Then wait for your project to be deployed.

## Forking the Repository on GitHub

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Estelindis/double-agent) that you want to fork.
2. In the upper right of the repository, click the "Fork" button.
3. A copy of the repository will now be available within your repositories.

Forking the GitHub repository makes a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository. This copy of the code can be edited without affecting the original code.

## Cloning the Repository on GitHub

1. In the upper section of the repository, click the dropdown named "Code."
2. In the "Clone with HTTPS" section, copy the URL.
3. Open Git Bash in your IDE of choice.
4. Change the current working directory to the location you want for the cloned directory.
5. Type "git clone" and paste the URL copied from GitHub.
6. After pressing Enter, the clone of your repository will be created.
